# ✨ Daily Tarot ✨

*Created by Graham Harris* \
\
This bot reads a daily tarot card every morning and tweets the result to the Twitter profile [@daily_tarotbot](https://twitter.com/daily_tarotbot).

## Usage

**cards.py**\
A set of lists that define each of the tarot cards in the deck and what they mean.\
\
**bot.py**\
The main bot. Enter consumer and access keys to operate the bot on a local machine. The bot randomizes a card from the tarot deck and tweets the result to the profile. The bot does not currently interact with followers, mentions, direct messages, etc.

## TODO
* Create more interesting/fun descriptions for each card
* Add images to each tweet
* Change name/header/bio/aesthetic to make the bot more appealing to followers
* If the bot chooses the same card twice in a row, it will not print
